I sat down one day trying to find a utility monitor I liked for macbooks, and I couldn't. So I made one.

Sysmon is a lightweight, open-source, privacy‚Äërespecting macOS menu‚Äëbar system monitor written in Rust that shows CPU usage, memory usage, and network throughput. 

**Performance**: ~26‚Äì33 MB RSS, ~0‚Äì1% CPU when idle (brief spikes when menu is open to 3-5%). App size is 754 KB on disk.

## technical overview

- **Architecture**: Rust + AppKit via `cocoa`/`objc` bindings
- **UI**: `NSStatusItem` manages the menu; `NSTimer` runs sampling while menu is open
- **System data**: `sysinfo` crate provides CPU percentages, memory usage, and network deltas
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead when idle, efficient polling only during active use

---

## Prerequisites

- **macOS** (10.12+ recommended)
- **Xcode Command Line Tools**: `xcode-select --install`
- **Rust toolchain**: Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)

---

## Build & Run

### Super Quick Start

Download sysmon.zip from root dir, unzip, and use! You will need to verify that the app is safe to use in system-settings.

### Quick Start from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kushaldudipala/sysmon.git
cd sysmon/sysmon

# Run the app (release build with locked dependencies)
cargo run --release --locked
```

The menu bar will show a new item üõ†Ô∏è. Click it to see system metrics. Quit via "Quit sysmon".

---

## Create a macOS .app bundle

```bash
cd sysmon/sysmon
cargo build --release
./tools/fetch_sysmon_app.sh
```

**Outputs:**
- `sysmon.app` (next to the crate)
- `../sysmon.zip` (one directory up)

**Note**: For unsigned apps, first run via Control‚Äëclick -> Open to bypass Gatekeeper.

---

## Security & Privacy

- **No elevated privileges**: Runs entirely in user space
- **No network access**: All data is read locally from system APIs
- **No persistent storage**: No configuration files or logs written
- **Sandboxed**: Compatible with macOS App Sandbox
- **Memory safe**: Written in Rust with proper error handling

## Future Expansions

Finding a way to add temp trackers on mac is really tricky without betraying the ideals behind sysmon. To be done next time!
